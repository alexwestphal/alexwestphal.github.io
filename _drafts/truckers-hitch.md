The truckers hitch has seen a fair bit of attention recently, most notably in a song/video from Norwegian comedy duo
[Ylvis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ylvis):

It is awesome to see knots featuring prominently in social media but there are a couple comments that need to be made
about the video:

- You will not learn to tie the truckers hitch (or any other knot) from the video
- It is impossible to know "every knot but one" (theoretically there are [infinitely many knot]({% post_url 2014-09-23-infinite-knots %}),
practically the [knot bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots) contains over 3800)
- The knot depicted in the video is the slipped overhand variant finished with two half hitches, making the knot look
excessively complicated ![Video Frame - Knot Book](/images/ylvis-book-figure-eight.png)
