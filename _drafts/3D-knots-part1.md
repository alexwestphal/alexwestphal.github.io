Since working on the [Drawing Knot Series]({% post_url 2014-09-06-drawing-knots-part1 %}), I've been working on
extending the concept. First by trying to animate the SVG's, then by rendering the knots in three dimensions.

In this article, I explain the basics of WebGL using [three.js](http://threejs.org) and how we use it to render a two
dimensional knot, in three dimensional space.
