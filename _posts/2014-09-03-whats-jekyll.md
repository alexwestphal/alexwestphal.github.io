title: What's Jekyll?

tags: jekyll github

Whats Jekyll? I found myself asking that question while reading through the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
documentation. The answer? A simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It doesn't sound like much but it turns out to
be totally awesome. Between Jekyll and GitHub Pages, this website needs no database, no management code and no user
accounts.

Jekyll provides static templates, partials, markdown processing and code highlighting. GitHub provides the free hosting
and all I have to do to make changes is push to the [git repository](https://github.com/phantomspectre/phantomspectre.github.io).
