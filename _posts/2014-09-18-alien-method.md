Recently my Venturer Unit introduced me to a new (rather violent) method for tying a Figure Eight knot. It is called the
*Alien Method*, and works as follows:

1. Make an alien near the running end of the rope ![Make Alien](/knots/alien1.svg)

2. Strangle the alien with the rope ![Strangle Alien](/knots/alien2.svg)

3. Punch the alien in the face ![Punch Alien](/knots/alien3.svg)

4. Kill the alien by pulling tight

There we have it, a Figure Eight knot and a dead alien.
