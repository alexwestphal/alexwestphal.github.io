Over the last few years, there has been much discussion about the place of Scouts in the 21st century. The general
consensus is that Scouts needs maintain it's core values of citizenship, leadership, and practical skills while
improving the quality of delivery and use of technology.

There is strong support for "better use of technology", but it is something that is easier said than done. The two
primary issues that hamper the the "better use of technology" are lack of understanding amongst the membership and
management practises that are stuck in the 20th century.

On the road to better technology there can be a variety stumbling blocks. One of the most pervasive is trap I like to
call "Shiny Beads for the Natives". In essence this is the tendency for those with insufficient understanding to be
unreasonably enamoured by things that are "shiny". A classic example of this is a recent game that was promoted by the
Scout Association in the UK:

The promotion of the game satisfies all the requirements of being "shiny": YouTube Video &#10003;, Mobile App &#10003;,
Cool Graphics &#10003;, Celebrity Endorsement &#10003;.

Unfortunately the app is actually rather rubbish, and I would strongly recommend against paying for the full version.
The in game graphics are way worse than the video, and there is very little Scout related in the app beyond the fact
the player is wearing a scarf.

Ignoring the issues relating to the quality of the game, what doe a Scout themed video game actual achieve? In the end,
not much. Instead we need to step back and consider wider concepts that affect planning and strategy throughout the
movement.

To truly succeed in the future Scouts there are four key concepts (and their relationship to technology) that need to be
considered. These concepts are Accessibility, Flexibility, Collaboration, and Progress. These concepts extend beyond
just Scouts and are becoming fundamental across all areas of business and society.

### Accessibility

Scouts is inaccessible to many youth, from those with physical or mental disabilities to minority groups and those
living remote communities. Technology can help us in making the programme more accessible to more people. If we could
deliver parts of the programme online, youth with disabilities or unable to reach all meetings would be able to do work
in their own time and not be disadvantaged.

One of the biggest challenges with leaders is training and being able to attend scheduled training sessions. If quality
material was available online, it would be possible to work through it on their own time.

One example of potential online training is using [interactive 3D technology](/3D/demo) to teach basic skills.

### Flexibility

The world is changing more rapidly then ever before, and our management and processes need to move with it. A good
example of the need for flexibility is the website used by Scouts NZ from 2009 to 2014. The site was built to order
with very little flexibility for any changes down the road. This resulted in a website that was obsolete within two
years. It took three years of planning after that for the replacement to be put in place.

The need for flexibility has been understood in the software development world for decades and drove the development of
a field known as [Agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

### Collaboration

The world is becoming increasingly connected, and we need to harness this connectivity to support collaboration between
both the youth and our leaders. Collaboration and communication can help to improve all other areas by supporting the
sharing of best practice and experience.


### Progress

Training for both youth and leaders needs to be progressive and continuous. Especially in the case of long serving
leaders, we need to make sure that their knowledge and skill stays up to date with current best practise.
